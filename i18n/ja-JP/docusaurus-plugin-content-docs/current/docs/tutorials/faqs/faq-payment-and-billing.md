## FAQs




### After adding a credit card, can I continue to use the expired credits left in my account?{#after-adding-a-credit-card-can-i-continue-to-use-the-expired-credits-left-in-my-account}

Yes. If there are still remaining credits in your account and you have added a payment method, the expiration of the remaining credits will be extended to 1 year.

### Will my $100 credits expire? How can I extend the expiration of the free credits?{#will-my-dollar100-credits-expire-how-can-i-extend-the-expiration-of-the-free-credits}

You will receive $100 credits to spend within 30 days upon your first registration. When the credits are going to expire, you can extend the expiration by adding a payment method on the Zilliz Cloud UI. If you choose to add a credit card, the expiration of the credits will be extended to 1 year. If you choose Marketplace subscription as the payment method, the expiration of the credits will also be extended to 1 year and you will earn $100 extra credits whose expiration is also 1 year.

### Is data in the Recycle Bin charged?{#is-data-in-the-recycle-bin-charged}

No. We do not charge you for deleted data in the Recycle Bin.
