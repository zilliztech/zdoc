# Metrics & Alerts Reference

In this reference, you can find descriptions of monitoring metrics for Zilliz Cloud clusters, as well as alert items that you can set up at organization and project levels.

## Available metrics{#available-metrics}

The **Metrics** tab in the Zilliz Cloud console presents various graphical representations. The table provides a description of each metric and the corresponding use cases.

|  Latency                 |  ms      |  The time elapsed between a client sending a request to a server and the client receiving a response. It includes an average latency and a P99 latency.<br/> - Search latency is indicated by the purple line.<br/> - Query latency is indicated by the blue line.<br/> - Bulk insert latency is indicated by the orange line.<br/> - Upsert latency is indicated by the green line.<br/> |  Monitor operation latency to track system efficiency.<br/> - To understand your system latency level, please refer to the [benchmark](https://zilliz.com/vector-database-benchmark-tool).<br/> - In most instances, a search request receives a response within milliseconds. If the response time extends to seconds or longer, it could indicate a cluster overload issue. It's worth noting that prolonged latencies can also arise when an excessive number of operations are batched into a single request.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
