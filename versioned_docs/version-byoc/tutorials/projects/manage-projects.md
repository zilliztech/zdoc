# Manage Projects

In Zilliz Cloud, a project serves as a logical container within an organization, grouping clusters and related resources. You can create multiple projects tailored to different aspects of your business. For example, if your company offers multimedia recommendation services, you can create one project for video recommendations and another for music recommendations.

This guide will walk you through the steps of managing projects.
