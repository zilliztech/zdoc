# Analyzer

In text processing, an **analyzer** is a crucial component that converts raw text into a structured, searchable format. Each analyzer typically consists of two core elements: **tokenizer** and **filter**. Together, they transform input text into tokens, refine these tokens, and prepare them for efficient indexing and retrieval. This chapter provides thorough information about using analyzers in Zilliz Cloud.
