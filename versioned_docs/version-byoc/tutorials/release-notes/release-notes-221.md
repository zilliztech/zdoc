(Release date: Sept. 27th, 2023)

## Cluster Enhancements - Increased Flexibility with a New CU Size Option{#cluster-enhancements-increased-flexibility-with-a-new-cu-size-option}

Cluster management has become more flexible with a new cluster size option - 6 CU. This option is ideal for users with smaller datasets looking for more cost-effective and efficient cluster options. Experience improved performance that is tailored to your specific needs.

## Support for Advance Pay{#support-for-advance-pay}

We now offer support for advance payments. This feature is specifically designed for our offline contract users who prefer to pay in advance for the services they will consume. By providing this option, we aim to streamline internal financial and procurement processes and minimize risk for our valued customers.

If you or your organization have specific requirements or would like to learn more about advance payment options, please don't hesitate to [__contact us__](https://zilliz.com/contact-sales).
