# Single Sign-on

Single sign-on (SSO) is a feature that allows users to log in to multiple applications or services with a single set of credentials, rather than requiring separate logins for each.

Zilliz Cloud allows you to enable SSO via the OpenID Connect ([OIDC](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/apps/apps_app_integration_wizard_oidc.htm)) or [SAML 2.0](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/apps/apps_app_integration_wizard_saml.htm) protocol. This feature works at the organization level.

<Admonition type="info" icon="📘" title="Notes">

<p>Zilliz Cloud SSO is currently available in <strong>General Availability</strong>. For access and implementation details, please contact <a href="https://zilliz.com/contact-sales">Zilliz Cloud support</a>.</p>
