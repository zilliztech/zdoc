# Single Sign-on with Okta

Single sign-on (SSO) is a feature that allows users to log in to multiple applications or services with a single set of credentials, rather than requiring separate logins for each.

Zilliz Cloud supports using [Okta](https://www.okta.com/) as the identity provider (IdP) to enable SSO via the OpenID Connect ([OIDC](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/apps/apps_app_integration_wizard_oidc.htm)) or [SAML 2.0](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/apps/apps_app_integration_wizard_saml.htm) protocol. This feature works at the organization level. By integrating with Okta, you can sign in using your Okta credentials to access Zilliz Cloud resources.
