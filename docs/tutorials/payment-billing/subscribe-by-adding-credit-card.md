# Subscribe by Adding Credit Card

This guide provides comprehensive instructions on how to add a payment credit card for your organization on Zilliz Cloud.

- **Accepted Credit Cards:** Zilliz Cloud currently accepts credit cards issued in the United States (USA), China, Hong Kong SAR, Macau SAR, and Taiwan. If your credit card is from a different country or region, please consider [subscribing through Marketplaces](./subscribe-on-aws-marketplace).

- **Taxation:** Taxes on the invoices are calculated based on the billing address you provide.
