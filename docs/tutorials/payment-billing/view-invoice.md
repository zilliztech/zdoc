# View Invoice

The total cost for using Zilliz Cloud services is determined by several components: compute, storage, backup, and migration costs. To help you monitor and manage your expenditures, you can access detailed invoices for both current and past billing cycles.

Please note that access to view invoices is restricted to organization owners.

## View invoices{#view-invoices}

To view your billing records, navigate to **Billing** in the left sidebar and select the **Invoices** tab. Within Zilliz Cloud, there are five possible billing statuses, each representing a different state of your payment. The table below outlines these statuses:

|  **Status**   |  **Definition**                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  **Paid**     |  Payment has been completed with no outstanding amounts.                                                                                                                      |
|  **Free**     |  All amounts due are paid with credits.                                                                                                                                       |
|  **Overdue**  |  The invoice is billed but not paid within the due timeframe.                                                                                                                 |
|  **Unbilled** |  Transactions that occur after the billing cycle but before the statement is generated. These amounts are not immediately due but will be included in the next billing cycle. |
|  **Unpaid**   |  The invoice is billed and is within the due timeframe.                                                                                                                       |
