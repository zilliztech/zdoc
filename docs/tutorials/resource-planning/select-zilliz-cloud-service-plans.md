# Select Service Tiers

The service plan that you choose has a significant impact on various aspects of your experience on Zilliz Cloud, including the billing model, scalability, and performance. Before setting up a cluster, you need to determine which service you require. Currently, Zilliz Cloud offers four distinct tiers that are tailored to meet different user needs:

- Starter (Serverless)

- Standard

- Enterprise

- Self-Hosted

Each of these service tiers is designed to accommodate different user demands and usage scenarios, ensuring convenience and flexibility.

## Starter tier{#starter-tier}

The Starter plan, which includes Serverless instances, is a user-friendly way to explore the services offered by Zilliz Cloud. All Zilliz Cloud users receive a free serverless cluster that can support up to two collections in a cluster that holds no more than 500,000, 768-dimensional vectors.

Serverless is a great option for individual users and testing workloads. Although it has limited support for Zilliz Cloud features, it has a very low entry barrier and eliminates the need for users to plan resources. Currently, the Serverless option in Zilliz Cloud is still in Beta phase, and only free trials are available.

## Standard tier{#standard-tier}

With the standard plan, you can take advantage of all three types of instances that Zilliz offers: Cost-optimized CU, Capacity-optimized CU, and Performance-optimized CU. You also have the flexibility to choose your preferred cloud provider and region.

The standard tier is ideal for small businesses or situations that are not critical to business operations, providing a range of functionalities on the Zilliz cloud platform at a reasonable cost. Users gain access to a physically isolated, dedicated cluster featuring the Zilliz proprietary vector search engine, Cardinal. This ensures a combination of low latency and stable performance, which highlights the plan's overall cost-effectiveness and efficiency. Currently, the Zilliz cloud standard plan supports up to 24 CUs, capable of handling a maximum of 30 million 768-dimensional vectors.

## Enterprise tier{#enterprise-tier}

With the enterprise plan, you can enjoy all the features of Zilliz Cloud, including multi-availability zone disaster recovery, Private Link, and automatic data backup. The enterprise plan comes with a Service Level Agreement (SLA) guarantee of 99.9% availability, as well as higher support priority.

This plan is best suited for enterprise-level users and business-critical use cases, where you will enjoy superior stability and scalability. Currently, Zilliz Cloud enterprise tier supports up to a maximum of 256 Computing Units (CUs) in a cluster, which can handle the loading of approximately 300M 768-dimensional vectors and can be scaled to several thousand CUs according to your needs.

## Self-Hosted{#self-hosted}

The self-hosted plan allows users to deploy Zilliz Cloud within their own Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). This option is particularly suitable for users with high security and compliance requirements, or those with specific customization needs. Typically, we only offer the self-hosted option to users with a scale of 128 Computing Units (CUs) or more.

For more details about the self-hosted feature, please contact Zilliz Support to obtain further information.
