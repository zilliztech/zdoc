## FAQs




### Can I use AWS, GCP, or Azure credits to offset Zilliz Cloud usage when subscribed via their respective marketplaces?{#can-i-use-aws-gcp-or-azure-credits-to-offset-zilliz-cloud-usage-when-subscribed-via-their-respective-marketplaces}

No, you cannot use the credits from cloud providers, such as AWS, GCP, or Azure, to offset Zilliz Cloud usage, even when subscribing through their marketplaces.

Zilliz Cloud usage is billed as a third-party service through each cloud provider’s marketplace, and most promotional or committed use credits issued by the cloud providers only apply to their native services, not third-party marketplace purchases.

For details, refer to the terms provided by these cloud providers. The following are extracts from those terms:

- [AWS Credits Terms](https://aws.amazon.com/awscredits/): AWS credits are applied to your AWS account and are only valid for AWS services.

- [Google Cloud Marketplace Terms](https://cloud.google.com/marketplace?hl=en): GCP credits typically apply to Google Cloud services only.

- [Azure Credit Usage Guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/understand/understand-azure-marketplace-charges): Visual Studio and other credits generally do not apply to third-party Marketplace offers.

### After adding a credit card, can I continue to use the expired credits left in my account?{#after-adding-a-credit-card-can-i-continue-to-use-the-expired-credits-left-in-my-account}

Yes. If there are still remaining credits in your account and you have added a payment method, the expiration of the remaining credits will be extended to 1 year.

### Will my &#36;100 credits expire? How can I extend the expiration of the free credits?{#will-my-and36100-credits-expire-how-can-i-extend-the-expiration-of-the-free-credits}

When you register an account for the first time with a business email, you will receive $100 in credits to spend within 30 days. When the credits are going to expire, you can extend the expiration by adding a payment method. After that you will receive an extra of $100 in credits to spend within 1 year.

### Is data in the Recycle Bin charged?{#is-data-in-the-recycle-bin-charged}

No. We do not charge you for deleted data in the Recycle Bin.
