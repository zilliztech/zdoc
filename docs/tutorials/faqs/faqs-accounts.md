![faq-org-frozen-banner](/img/faq-org-frozen-banner.png)

When your organization is frozen, your access to Zilliz Cloud services is limited. For instance, you cannot perform cluster-and collection-level operations on dedicated clusters on the web console or via SDK. 

### How can I unfreeze my organization?{#how-can-i-unfreeze-my-organization}

If you are an organization member, you can only contact your organization owner to perform the operations and unfreeze the organization.

If you are an organization owner, you can perform the following operations depending on the type of your organization:

- If your organization does not have a payment method, you can unfreeze your organization by [adding a payment credit card](./subscribe-by-adding-credit-card) or [subscribing to Zilliz Cloud on ](./subscribe-on-aws-marketplace)[AWS Marketplace](./subscribe-on-aws-marketplace). Once a payment method is added or AWS Marketplace Subscription is completed, you can continue using Zilliz Cloud services and enjoy the benefits of creating dedicated clusters.

- If your organization has already added a credit card but has overdue invoices, you can unfreeze your organization by checking the expiration and balance of your credit card and then retrying the payment.

- If your organization has already subscribed to Zilliz Cloud on AWS Marketplace, you can unfreeze your organization by visiting [AWS Billing](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-iqbidum7feuio?sr=0-1&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa) and fixing your overdue payment there.

If you are still unable to unfreeze your organization after trying the above operations, please[ submit a request](https://support.zilliz.com/hc/en-us).
