## Metrics explained{#metrics-explained}

On the **Metrics** tab, you can find the following curves:

- CU usage
    This metric displays the percentage fluctuation of either CPU or memory usage, whichever is greater, per second during a specified time duration.

- Storage usage
    This metric displays the variation in consumed block storage size, measured in gigabytes per second, over a specified time period.

- Queries per second (QPS)
    This metric displays the fluctuation in the number of queries per second during a specified time duration.

- Query latency
    This metric displays the fluctuation of query latency, measured in milliseconds, over a specified time period.
