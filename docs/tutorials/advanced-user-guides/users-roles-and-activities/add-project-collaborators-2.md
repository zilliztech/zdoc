# Add Project Collaborators

Once organization members are granted project-level permissions, they become project collaborators and can access the projects they are authorized to access.

This topic describes how to add collaborators to a project.

    To add users that belong to the organization but have no permissions on the specified project, select their usernames directly from the drop-down list. To add users that do not belong to the organization where the project is created, enter their email addresses. Each time you enter an email address, press “Enter” to check if the specified value is valid.

## Result{#result}

You can add one or more collaborators to a project at a time. For users that belong to the organization, Zilliz Cloud sends an email to notify that they are in the project. For users that do not belong to the organization, Zilliz Cloud sends an invitation email. By accepting invitation, they join the project and become a project collaborator.
