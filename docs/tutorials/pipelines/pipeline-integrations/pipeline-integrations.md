# Pipeline Integrations

Still do not know how to integrate great open-source and third-party services with Zilliz Cloud Pipelines? Use these guides to start with. 

<Admonition type="info" icon="📘" title="Notes">

<p>Zilliz Cloud Pipelines will be discontinued by the end of Q2 2025 and replaced by a new feature, “Data In, Data Out,” to streamline embedding generation in both Milvus and Zilliz Cloud. As of December 24, 2024, new user registrations are no longer accepted. Current users can continue using the service within the &#36;20 monthly free allowance until the sunset date; however, no SLA is provided. Please consider using embedding APIs from model providers or open-source models to generate vector embeddings.</p>
