# Create Pipelines

You can create pipelines either on the Zilliz Cloud console or via RESTful APIs. The Zilliz Cloud web UI provides a simplified and intuitive way of creating Pipelines while creating pipelines via RESTful API offers more flexibility and customization compared to the Web UI.

There are three types of pipelines that you can create on Zilliz Cloud.

- Ingestion pipeline

- Search pipeline

- Deletion pipeline
