# Ingest, Search, and Delete Data

Learn how to ingest, search, and delete various formats of unstructured data (eg. Images, texts, docs, etc.) with Zilliz Cloud Pipelines. Currently, three data formats are supported.

<Admonition type="info" icon="📘" title="Notes">

<p>Zilliz Cloud Pipelines will be discontinued by the end of Q2 2025 and replaced by a new feature, “Data In, Data Out,” to streamline embedding generation in both Milvus and Zilliz Cloud. As of December 24, 2024, new user registrations are no longer accepted. Current users can continue using the service within the $20 monthly free allowance until the sunset date; however, no SLA is provided. Please consider using embedding APIs from model providers or open-source models to generate vector embeddings.</p>
