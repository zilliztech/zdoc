The release also includes **multi-replica** functionality in public preview, allowing users to improve query throughput and availability by distributing workloads across replicas in multiple Availability Zones (AZs). Additionally, Zilliz Cloud’s new **Migration Service** supports seamless migration from open-source Milvus, pgvector, Elasticsearch, and enables intra-organization and cross-organization data migrations within Zilliz Cloud. The **expanded** **RESTful APIs** for backup, restore, migration, and job management empower users to build automated operational workflows. Further enhancements include support for Project Read-only roles and the ability to rename clusters and snapshots.

### Milvus Compatibility{#milvus-compatibility}

This release is compatible with **Milvus 2.4.x**.

### Serverless GA{#serverless-ga}

After a year of refinement, Zilliz Cloud Serverless is now generally available. 

Designed as a hassle-free serverless vector database for GenAI applications, Zilliz Cloud Serverless offers automatic scaling that adjusts to your app's demands, delivering up to 50x cost savings. Its cost-efficiency is driven by a tiered storage system that optimizes data placement across DRAM, SSD, and object storage, ensuring quick access to active data while reducing costs for less frequently used information—all without manual intervention.

Unlike dedicated clusters, serverless service ensures you only pay for what you use, eliminating the costs for idle servers. With seamless data portability, you can easily transfer your data from open-source Milvus or to dedicated clusters, as your needs change.

### Milvus 2.4.x New Features GA on Zilliz Cloud{#milvus-24x-new-features-ga-on-zilliz-cloud}

Milvus 2.4 offers many highly practical capabilities for RAG and multimodal data search. If you want to try these new features, you can update your cluster to BETA. Since Milvus 2.4 has not reached a stable version, be cautious when you adopt Milvus 2.4 features in your production environment.

#### Sparse Vector{#sparse-vector}

Sparse vectors are different from their dense counterparts as they tend to have several magnitude higher number of dimensions with only a handful being non-zero. This feature offers better interpretability due to its term-based nature and can be more effective in certain domains. Learned sparse models such as SPLADEv2/BGE-M3 have proven to be very useful for common first-stage ranking tasks. The main use case for this new feature is to allow efficient approximate semantic nearest neighbor search over sparse vectors generated by neural models such as SPLADEv2/BGE-M3 and statistics models such as the BM25 algorithm. Zilliz Cloud now supports effective and high-performance storage, indexing, and searching (MIPS, Maximum Inner Product Search) of sparse vectors.

Example code can be found in [hello_sparse.py](https://github.com/milvus-io/pymilvus/blob/2.4/examples/hello_sparse.py).

#### Multi Embedding & Hybrid Search{#multi-embedding-and-hybrid-search}

Multi-vector support is the cornerstone for applications that require multi-model data processing or a mix of dense and sparse vectors. With multi-vector support, now you can:

- Store vector embeddings generated for unstructured text, image, or audio samples from multiple models.

- Conduct ANN searches that include multiple vectors of each entity.

- Customize search strategies by assigning weights to different embedding models.

- Experiment with various embedding models to find the optimal model combination.

Multi-vector support allows storing, indexing, and applying reranking strategies to multiple vector fields of different types, such as FLOAT_VECTOR and SPARSE_FLOAT_VECTOR, in a collection. Currently, two reranking strategies are available: **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)** and **Average Weighted Scoring**. Both strategies combine the search results from different vector fields into a unified result set. The first strategy prioritizes the entities that consistently appear in the search results of different vector fields, while the other strategy assigns weights to the search results of each vector field to determine their importance in the final result set.

Example code can be found in [hybrid_search.py](https://github.com/milvus-io/pymilvus/blob/2.4/examples/hybrid_search.py).

#### Inverted Index and Fuzzy Match{#inverted-index-and-fuzzy-match}

In previous releases of Milvus, memory-based binary search indexes and Marisa Trie indexes were used for scalar field indexing. However, these methods were memory-intensive. The latest release of Zilliz Cloud now employs the Tantivy-based inverted index, which can be applied to all numeric and string data types. This new index dramatically improves scalar query performance, reducing the query of keywords in strings by ten times. In addition, The inverted index consumes less memory, thanks to additional optimizations in data compression and Memory-mapped storage (MMap) mechanism of the internal indexing structure.

This release also supports fuzzy matches in scalar filtering using prefixes, infixes, and suffixes.

Example code can be found in [inverted_index_example.py](https://github.com/milvus-io/pymilvus/blob/2.4/examples/inverted_index_example.py) and [fuzzy_match.py](https://github.com/milvus-io/pymilvus/blob/2.4/examples/fuzzy_match.py).

#### Grouping Search{#grouping-search}

You can now aggregate the search results by the values in a specific scalar field. This helps RAG applications to implement document-level recall. Consider a collection of documents, each document splits into various passages. Each passage is represented by one vector embedding and belongs to one document. To find the most relevant documents instead of scattering passages, you can include the group_by_field argument in the search() operation to group results by the document ID.

Example code can be found in [example_group_by.py](https://github.com/milvus-io/pymilvus/blob/2.4/examples/example_group_by.py).

#### Float16 and BFloat- Vector DataType{#float16-and-bfloat-vector-datatype}

Machine learning and neural networks often use half-precision data types, such as Float16 and BFloat- While these data types can improve query efficiency and reduce memory usage, they come with a tradeoff of reduced accuracy. With this release, Zilliz Cloud now supports these data types for vector fields.

Example code can be found in [float16_example.py](https://github.com/milvus-io/pymilvus/blob/2.4/examples/float16_example.py) and [bfloat16_example.py](https://github.com/milvus-io/pymilvus/blob/2.4/examples/bfloat16_example.py).

### Multi-replica{#multi-replica}

Multi-replica is now available in Zilliz Cloud, enabling cluster-level replication to boost both query throughput and availability.

- **Improved Query Performance**: For users requiring high query-per-second (QPS), multi-replica allows query workloads to be distributed across replicas. This parallel processing enhances overall throughput, reduces latency, and improves efficiency for query-intensive applications. In most cases, the overall QPS can be improved linearly as replicas are added.

- **Enhanced Availability**: Multi-replica strengthens availability by distributing replicas across multiple Availability Zones (AZs). This setup ensures continuous access to data, even in the event of an AZ outage, offering greater reliability for mission-critical applications.

Currently, the multi-replica feature is in public preview and is available on the Enterprise Plan. To find more, read [Manage Replica](./manage-replica).

### Migration Service{#migration-service}

Zilliz Cloud now offers a comprehensive Migration Service, allowing users to seamlessly complete migration tasks. Currently, three types of migrations are supported:

- Migrate from open-source Milvus to Zilliz Cloud. The migration target can be a Free Plan instance, Serverless instance, or Dedicated Cluster. For details, refer to [Migrate from Milvus to Zilliz Cloud](./migrate-from-milvus).

- Migrate from other open-source databases to Zilliz Cloud, with current support for migrations from pgvector and Elasticsearch. The migration target can be a Free Plan instance, Serverless instance, or Dedicated Cluster. For details, refer to [Migrate from Elasticsearch to Zilliz Cloud](./migrate-from-elasticsearch) and [Migrate from pgvector to Zilliz Cloud](./migrate-from-pgvector).

- Migrate data within Zilliz Cloud, supporting both intra-organization and cross-organization data migrations. For details, refer to [Cross-Cluster Migrations](./migrate-between-clusters).

### Backup/Restore/Migration/Jobs RESTful API{#backuprestoremigrationjobs-restful-api}

With this update, Zilliz Cloud has expanded the control plane API, introducing new functionalities that support backup, restore, migration, and job management.

These RESTful APIs allow users to build their own automated operational workflows, providing greater flexibility and control over their data management and maintenance processes.
