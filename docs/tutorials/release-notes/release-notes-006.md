# Release Notes (Aug 30, 2022)

The latest Zilliz Cloud update introduces a range of enhancements, including support for larger standard vector databases, streamlined management of collections and indexes directly from the Cloud UI, and the ability to execute vector searches within the same interface. For enhanced security, database access from the Internet is now disabled by default, with an improved whitelisting experience to manage access. The platform also introduces a credit system and further refines the Cloud UI for more intuitive interaction.
