# Organizations

In Zilliz Cloud, each organization can handle multiple projects. Once you sign up for Zilliz Cloud, you automatically become the [owner](./user-roles) of your own organization. While you can't create new organizations, you can join others by invitation.

This guide will walk you through the steps of managing organizations.

## View organizations{#view-organizations}

After logging into the [Zilliz Cloud console](https://cloud.zilliz.com/login), you'll land on the page listing the organizations you're part of. You can check out and enter these organizations.

For a quick view of all the organizations you've joined, just click **All Organizations** in the top left corner.

## Rename an organization{#rename-an-organization}

To rename an organization, you must be an [Organization Owner](./resource-hierarchy).

You can rename an organization in either of the following ways:

- Rename an organization on the organization list page:

    ![rename-organization](/img/rename-organization.png)

- Enter an organization and rename it on the **System Settings** page:

## Leave an organization{#leave-an-organization}

When you no longer belong to an organization, you have the option to leave it.

Each organization must have at least one organization owner. If you are the only owner of an organization, you cannot leave it.
