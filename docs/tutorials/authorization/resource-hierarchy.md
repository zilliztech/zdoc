## Understand organizations{#understand-organizations}

Organizations serve as a means to group projects that share common objectives, such as encompassing all projects under a particular business unit.

In an organization, you can create several projects and manage organization-level resources, including [billing](/docs/payment-billing), [API keys](./manage-api-keys), [organization members](./organization-users), [activities](./view-activities), [organization settings](./organization-settings), and [recycle bin](./use-recycle-bin).

## Understand projects{#understand-projects}

Projects are logical containers within an organization that group clusters and other associated resources.

In a project, you can create several clusters and manage cluster-level resources, including [clusters](./manage-cluster), [project collaborators](./project-users), [pipelines](./pipelines), [security](./network-and-security), and [project alerts](./manage-project-alerts).
