# Single Sign-On

With the single sign-on (SSO) feature, you can conveniently access the Zilliz Cloud console using a single set of login credentials. This eliminates the need for a separate Zilliz Cloud account. By implementing SSO, you can simplify user access and reinforce security by centralizing the authentication process.

The SSO feature offered by Zilliz Cloud works at the [organization](./resource-hierarchy) level and requires the [SAML 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML_2.0) protocol. 

<Admonition type="info" icon="📘" title="Notes">

<p>Currently, the SSO feature is in Public Preview and available only to users in the whitelist. If you are interested in using this feature, please <a href="https://support.zilliz.com/hc/en-us">submit a ticket</a>.</p>
