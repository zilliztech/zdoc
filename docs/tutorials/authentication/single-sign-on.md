# Single Sign-On

With the single sign-on (SSO) feature, you can conveniently access the Zilliz Cloud console using a single set of login credentials. This eliminates the need for a separate Zilliz Cloud account. By implementing SSO, you can simplify user access and reinforce security by centralizing the authentication process.

The SSO feature offered by Zilliz Cloud works at the organization level and requires the [SAML 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML_2.0) protocol.

<p>Currently, the SSO feature is in beta and available only to users in the whitelist. If you are interested in using this feature, <a href="https://zilliz.com/contact-sales">contact us</a>.</p>
