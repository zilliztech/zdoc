# Metrics & Alerts Reference

In this reference, you can find descriptions of monitoring metrics for Zilliz Cloud clusters, as well as alert targets that you can set up at organization and project levels.

## Cluster metrics{#cluster-metrics}

The __Metrics__ tab in the Zilliz Cloud console presents various graphical representations.

The table provides a description of each metric and the actions that you are advised to perform when the usage of your cluster resource exceeds a threshold.
