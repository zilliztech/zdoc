# Free Trials

Zilliz Cloud offers three subscription plans: **Starter**, **Standard**, and **Enterprise**.

- The **Starter** plan provides a serverless cluster available on GCP, the simplest way to experience a fully-managed vector database. This tier is suitable for for hobbyists or developers who want to experiment with Zilliz Cloud. No credit card is required, and minimal configuration is needed.

- The **Standard** plan is designed for small or mid-sized teams with less complex workloads. This option offers a dedicated cluster available on both AWS and GCP, perfect for users who need a cost-efficient solution to process large-scale data with dedicated clusters.

- The **Enterprise** plan is for at-scale organizations that require dedicated clusters with advanced features, high availability and security, and 24/7/365 support. It is available on both AWS and GCP.

Both the **Starter** and **Standard** plans come with a free trial.

## Starter plan free trial{#starter-plan-free-trial}

The free trial of the **Starter** plan offers a free serverless cluster. You can create up to two collections. Each collection can hold approximately 500,000 768-dimensional vectors. We recommend choosing the **Starter plan** if you want to quickly get started with a vector database or swiftly build your AI application.

Zilliz Cloud offers this free trial for every signup user. Select the **Starter** plan during cluster creation to obtain a free serverless cluster. For more information on creating a serverless cluster, see [Create Cluster](./create-cluster).

Enjoy!

## Standard plan free trial{#standard-plan-free-trial}

The **Standard** plan offers a 30-day free trial with $100 free credits. If you wish to use a dedicated cluster for a larger-scale Proof of Concept (PoC), we recommend choosing the free trial of the **Standard** plan. The maximum cluster size that can be self-provisioned during the free trial is 4 CUs. If this is insufficient to support your PoC, you can [contact us](https://zilliz.com/contact-sales) to enable a larger cluster or apply for additional credits.

Zilliz Cloud provides $100 free credits for every signup users. You can use these credits to experience a dedicated cluster’s features by selecting the **Standard** plan during cluster creation. For more information on creating a dedicated cluster, see [Create Cluster](./create-cluster).

If you attach an AWS Marketplace account with Zilliz Cloud, we will offer you another $100 free credits. In addition, if you add a payment method (credit card or AWS Marketplace), we will extend the validity of your free credits to one year.
