## Revoke or resend an invitation{#revoke-or-resend-an-invitation}

When you invite an existing organization member to a project within the same organization, they automatically gain access to the project without receiving a separate invitation. However, if you invite someone to a project within an organization they are not already a part of, they will receive an invitation to join the organization, which also grants them access to the specified project.

To revoke or resend the invitation, you must be an [Organization Owner](./a-panorama-view#organization-roles) or a [Project Owner](./a-panorama-view#project-roles).

:::info Notes

You can revoke or resend an invitation before the user accepts it.

:::

## Edit a collaborator's role or remove a collaborator{#edit-a-collaborators-role-or-remove-a-collaborator}

After a user accepts the invitation, the user becomes a project collaborator.

To edit a collaborator's role or remove a project collaborator, you must be an [Organization Owner](./a-panorama-view#organization-roles) or a [Project Owner](./a-panorama-view#project-roles).

![edit-user-role-or-remove-project-user](/img/edit-user-role-or-remove-project-user.png)

## Leave a project{#leave-a-project}

When you no longer belong to a project, you have the option to leave it.

Note that if you are the only owner of a project, you cannot leave it as each project must have at least one project owner at all times.

:::caution Warning

Once you leave a project, your access to the project and associated resources will be revoked.
