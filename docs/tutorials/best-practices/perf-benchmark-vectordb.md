# Performance Benchmarking with VectorDBBench

[VectorDBBench](https://github.com/zilliztech/VectorDBBench) is an open-source benchmarking tool designed specifically for vector databases. 

This topic introduces how to use VectorDBBench to reproduce the performance test results of Zilliz Cloud. 

## Overview{#overview}

VectorDBBench is not just an offering of benchmark results for mainstream vector databases and cloud services, it is also a tool for the ultimate performance and cost-effectiveness comparison. 

VectorDBBench provides an intuitive visual interface. This not only empowers users to initiate benchmarks at ease, but also to view comparative result reports, thereby reproducing benchmark results effortlessly. 

Closely mimicking real-world production environments, VectorDBBench has set up diverse testing scenarios including insertion, searching, and filtered searching. To provide you with credible and reliable data, VectorDBBench has also included public datasets from actual production scenarios, such as [__SIFT__](http://corpus-texmex.irisa.fr/), [__GIST__](http://corpus-texmex.irisa.fr/), [__Cohere__](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Cohere/wikipedia-22-12/tree/main/en), and a dataset generated by OpenAI from an open-source [__raw dataset__](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/c4). 

## Benchmark metrics{#benchmark-metrics}

|  **Metric**                  |  **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |  **Test Scenario**        |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
|  Max_load_count              |  The capacity of a vector database. VectorDBBench will keep inserting vector data into the vector database until the database fails or reject the insertion request over 10 times and keep a record of the maximum number of inserted entities.<br/> Higher Max_load_count values indicate better vector database performance. |  Insertion                |
|  QPS                         |  The capability of a vector database to handle concurrent queries per second. VectorDBBench uses top-100 searches in multiple times and selects the highest QPS value as the final result.<br/> Higher QPS values indicate better vector database performance.                                                                 |  Search & filtered search |
|  Recall                      |  The measure of search accuracy by comparing search results with ground truth.<br/> Higher recall values indicate better vector database performance.                                                                                                                                                                          |  Search & filtered search |
|  Load_duration               |  The time it takes for Zilliz Cloud to complete the process of inserting entities and building indexes.<br/> Lower Load_duration values indicate better vector database performance.                                                                                                                                           |  Search & filtered search |
|  Serial_latancy_p99<br/>  |  The time that 99% of queries take to complete. VectorDBBench records the search latency of each top-100 searches and uses the 99th percentile average as the final result.<br/> Lower Serial_latancy_p99 values indicate better vector database performance.                                                                  |  Search & filtered search |

## Prerequisites{#prerequisites}

- You need to have a [registered Zilliz Cloud account](./register-with-zilliz-cloud).

- [Create at least one cluster](./create-cluster). Zilliz Cloud provides free serverless clusters for you to quickly get onboard and start exploring Zilliz Cloud vector database.

- You need to have Python 3.11 or later installed.
