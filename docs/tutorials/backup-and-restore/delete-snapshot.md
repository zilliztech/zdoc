# Delete Snapshot

Zilliz Cloud automatically removes the snapshots when they reach the end of their retention period. You can manually delete any available snapshots before then.

![delete_backups](/img/delete_backups.png)

You will be prompted to verify your request to delete a snapshot before Zilliz Cloud actually performs the deletion.
