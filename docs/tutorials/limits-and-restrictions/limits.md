## Collections{#collections}

|  **Cluster Type**                                    |  **Max Number**                              |  **Remarks**                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  Serverless cluster |  2<br/>  |  You can create up to 2 serverless collections.                                           |
|  Dedicated cluster<br/>                           |  64 per CU, and <= 4096                      |  You can create up to 64 collections per CU used in a dedicated cluster and no more than 4,096 collections in the cluster. |

In addition to the limits on the number of collections per cluster, Zilliz Cloud also applies limits on consumed capacity. The following table lists the limits on the general capacity of a cluster.

|  **Number of CUs** |  **General Capacity**            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
|  1-8 CUs           |  <= 4,096                        |
|  12 CUs and more   |  Min(512 x Number of CUs, 65536) |

The consumed capacity should be less than the general capacity available.

<Admonition type="info" icon="📘" title="Notes">

The following explains how Zilliz Cloud calculates the consumed capacity and general capacity of a cluster.

- **Calculating the consumed capacity in a cluster**

    For instance, let's assume that you have created **50** collections in a cluster; each of the first **20** collections has **2** partitions and **4** shards, while each of the remaining **30** collections has **1** partition and **12** shards. The consumed capacity of the cluster can be calculated as follows:

    **20 (collections) x 2 (partitions) x 4 (shards) + 30 (collections) x 1 (partitions) x 12 (shards) = 160 + 360 = 520**

    Based on the above calculation, Zilliz Cloud regards the cluster has a consumed capacity of **520**.

- **Calculating the general capacity of a cluster**

    The general capacity can be determined using the following formula:

    **Min(512 x Number of CUs, 65536)**

    For instance, 

    - In a cluster of **2** CUs, you can create a maximum of **128** collections with a general capacity of **1,024**.

    - In a cluster of **12** CUs, you can create a maximum of **768** collections with a general capacity of **6,144**.

    - In a cluster of **32** CUs or more, you can create a maximum of **4,096** collections with a general capacity of **65,536**.

</Admonition>

Additionally, the rate limit for creating collections is **1 **collection/s per cluster.

### Partitions{#partitions}

|  **Cluster Type**                                    |  **Max number (Per collection)**              |  **Remarks**                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|  Serverless cluster |  64<br/>  |  You can create up to 64 partitions per collection in a serverless cluster. |
|  Dedicated cluster<br/>                           |  4,096                                        |  You can create up to 4,096 partitions per collection in a dedicated cluster.                                |

When calculating the consumed and general capacity, refer to the notes in [Collections](./limits#collections). Additionally, the rate limit for creating partitions is **1** partition/s per cluster.

### Shards{#shards}

When creating a collection, you can create up to **8** shards for the collection. If not specified, a collection has a shard by default.

|  **Item**        |  **Max Number** |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
|   1-8 CUs        |  2              |
|  12 CUs and more |  8              |

You are advised to keep the default settings for the shard number when creating collections, especially for clusters using no more than **24** CUs.

When calculating the consumed and general capacity, refer to the notes in [Collections](./limits#collections). 

### Fields{#fields}

|  **Item**                     |  **Max Number** |  **Remarks**                                            |
| ----------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
|  Fields per collection        |  64             |  N/A                                                    |
|  Vector fields per collection |  1              |  The support for multiple vector fields is coming soon. |

Other limits on fields:

- Null values are not supported by any field types.

- Some fields, such as VarChar or JSON, use more memory than expected and can cause the cluster to become full.
