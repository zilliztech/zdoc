## Collections{#collections}

|  __Cluster Type__                                    |  __Max Number__                              |  __Remarks__                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  Serverless cluster |  2<br/>  |  You can create up to 2 serverless collections.                                           |
|  Dedicated cluster<br/>                           |  64 per CU, and <= 4096                      |  You can create up to 64 collections per CU used in a dedicated cluster and no more than 4,096 collections in the cluster. |

In addition to the limits on the number of collections per cluster, Zilliz Cloud also applies limits on consumed capacity. The following table lists the limits on the general capacity of a cluster.

|  __Number of CUs__ |  __General Capacity__            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
|  1-8 CUs           |  <= 4,096                        |
|  12 CUs and more   |  Min(512 x Number of CUs, 65536) |

The consumed capacity should be less than the general capacity available.

<Admonition type="info" icon="📘" title="Notes">

<p>The following explains how Zilliz Cloud calculates the consumed capacity and general capacity of a cluster.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calculating the consumed capacity in a cluster</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>For instance, let's assume that you have created <strong>50</strong> collections in a cluster; each of the first <strong>20</strong> collections has <strong>2</strong> partitions and <strong>4</strong> shards, while each of the remaining <strong>30</strong> collections has <strong>1</strong> partition and <strong>12</strong> shards. The consumed capacity of the cluster can be calculated as follows:</p>
<p><strong>20 (collections) x 2 (partitions) x 4 (shards) + 30 (collections) x 1 (partitions) x 12 (shards) = 160 + 360 = 520</strong></p>
<p>Based on the above calculation, Zilliz Cloud regards the cluster has a consumed capacity of <strong>520</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calculating the general capacity of a cluster</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The general capacity can be determined using the following formula:</p>
<p><strong>Min(512 x Number of CUs, 65536)</strong></p>
<p>For instance, </p>
<ul>
<li><p>In a cluster of <strong>2</strong> CUs, you can create a maximum of <strong>128</strong> collections with a general capacity of <strong>1,024</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>In a cluster of <strong>12</strong> CUs, you can create a maximum of <strong>768</strong> collections with a general capacity of <strong>6,144</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>In a cluster of <strong>32</strong> CUs or more, you can create a maximum of <strong>4,096</strong> collections with a general capacity of <strong>65,536</strong>. </p></li>
</ul>

</Admonition>

Additionally, the rate limit for creating collections is __1 __collection/s per cluster.

### Partitions{#partitions}

|  __Cluster Type__                                    |  __Max number (Per collection)__              |  __Remarks__                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|  Serverless cluster |  64<br/>  |  You can create up to 64 partitions per collection in a serverless cluster. |
|  Dedicated cluster<br/>                           |  4,096                                        |  You can create up to 4,096 partitions per collection in a dedicated cluster.                                |

When calculating the consumed and general capacity, refer to the notes in [Collections](./limits#collections). Additionally, the rate limit for creating partitions is __1__ partition/s per cluster.

### Shards{#shards}

When creating a collection, you can create up to __8__ shards for the collection. If not specified, a collection has a shard by default.

|  __Item__        |  __Max Number__ |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
|   1-8 CUs        |  2              |
|  12 CUs and more |  8              |

You are advised to keep the default settings for the shard number when creating collections, especially for clusters using no more than __24__ CUs.

When calculating the consumed and general capacity, refer to the notes in [Collections](./limits#collections). 

### Fields{#fields}

|  __Item__                     |  __Max Number__ |  __Remarks__                                            |

|  Fields per collection        |  64             |  N/A                                                    |
|  Vector fields per collection |  1              |  The support for multiple vector fields is coming soon. |

Other limits on fields:

- Null values are not supported by any field types.

- Some fields, such as VarChar or JSON, use more memory than expected and can cause the cluster to become full.
