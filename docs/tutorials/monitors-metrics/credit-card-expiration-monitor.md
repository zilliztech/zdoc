# Stay Informed on Credit Card Expiration

Zilliz Cloud has a credit card expiration monitor that is disabled by default. If you have registered a credit card with us, you can choose to enable it. This will allow you to receive notifications from us before your credit card expires.

This is a feature available only to clusters in the Standard and Enterprise plans.
