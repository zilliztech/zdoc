# Monitor CU Resources

To effectively scale your cluster, it is recommended to activate the CU resource monitor. This tool tracks both CPU and memory usage, expressed as a percentage, and responds based on the higher of the two values.

<Admonition type="info" icon="📘" title="Notes">

This is a feature exclusively available to clusters in the Standard and Enterprise plans.

1. Select **Monitoring** from the project’s left navigation pane.

1. Navigate to the **Monitor Settings** tab.

1. Find the initial condition in the **Resource Alerts** card. By default, notifications are set to be sent when **CU Usage** exceeds **90%** for a duration of more than **10 minutes**.

1. Click **…** in the **Actions** column, and select **Edit**.

1. Adjust the **CU **usage threshold and **Duration** settings as per your requirements in the dialog box that appears. Click **Save** to apply your customized alert condition.
