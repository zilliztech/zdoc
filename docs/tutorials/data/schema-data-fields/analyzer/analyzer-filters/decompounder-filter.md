# Decompounder

The `decompounder` filter splits compound words into individual components based on a specified dictionary, making it easier to search for parts of compound terms. This filter is particularly useful for languages that frequently use compound words, such as German.

## Configuration{#configuration}

The `decompounder` filter is a custom filter in Zilliz Cloud. To use it, specify `"type": "decompounder"` in the filter configuration, along with a `word_list` parameter that provides the dictionary of word components to recognize.

<Tabs groupId="code" defaultValue='python' values={[{"label":"Python","value":"python"},{"label":"Java","value":"java"}]}>
<TabItem value='python'>

```python
analyzer_params = {
    "tokenizer": "standard",
    "filter":[{
        "type": "decompounder", # Specifies the filter type as decompounder
        "word_list": ["dampf", "schiff", "fahrt", "brot", "backen", "automat"],
    }],
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value='java'>

```java
Map<String, Object> analyzerParams = new HashMap<>();
analyzerParams.put("tokenizer", "standard");
analyzerParams.put("filter",
        Collections.singletonList(
                new HashMap<String, Object>() {{
                    put("type", "decompounder");
                    put("word_list", Arrays.asList("dampf", "schiff", "fahrt", "brot", "backen", "automat"));
                }}
        )
);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The `decompounder` filter accepts the following configurable parameters.

<table>
   <tr>
     <th><p>Parameter</p></th>
     <th><p>Description</p></th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td><p><code>word_list</code></p></td>
     <td><p>A list of word components used to split compound terms. This dictionary determines how compound words are decomposed into individual terms.</p></td>
   </tr>
</table>

The `decompounder` filter operates on the terms generated by the tokenizer, so it must be used in combination with a tokenizer. For a list of tokenizers available in Zilliz Cloud, refer to [Tokenizer Reference](./analyzer-tokenizers).

After defining `analyzer_params`, you can apply them to a `VARCHAR` field when defining a collection schema. This allows Zilliz Cloud to process the text in that field using the specified analyzer for efficient tokenization and filtering. For details, refer to [Example use](./analyzer-overview#example-use).

## Example output{#example-output}

Here’s an example of how the `decompounder` filter processes text:

**Original text**:

```python
"dampfschifffahrt brotbackautomat"
```

**Expected output** (with `word_list: ["dampf", "schiff", "fahrt", "brot", "backen", "automat"]`):

```python
["dampf", "schiff", "fahrt", "brotbackautomat"]
```
