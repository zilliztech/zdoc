# Performance Benchmarking with VectorDBBench

[VectorDBBench](https://github.com/zilliztech/VectorDBBench) is an open-source benchmarking tool designed specifically for vector databases. 

This topic introduces how to use VectorDBBench to reproduce the performance test results of Zilliz Cloud. 

## Overview{#overview}

VectorDBBench is not just an offering of benchmark results for mainstream vector databases and cloud services, it is also a tool for the ultimate performance and cost-effectiveness comparison. 

VectorDBBench provides an intuitive visual interface. This not only empowers users to initiate benchmarks at ease, but also to view comparative result reports, thereby reproducing benchmark results effortlessly. 

Closely mimicking real-world production environments, VectorDBBench has set up diverse testing scenarios including insertion, searching, and filtered searching. To provide you with credible and reliable data, VectorDBBench has also included public datasets from actual production scenarios, such as [SIFT](http://corpus-texmex.irisa.fr/), [GIST](http://corpus-texmex.irisa.fr/), [Cohere](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Cohere/wikipedia-22-12/tree/main/en), and a dataset generated by OpenAI from an open-source [raw dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/c4).

## Prerequisites{#prerequisites}

- You need to have a [registered Zilliz Cloud account](/docs/register-with-zilliz-cloud).

- [Create at least one cluster](/docs/create-cluster). Zilliz Cloud provides [free](./free-trials) clusters for you to quickly get onboard and start exploring Zilliz Cloud vector database.

- You need to have Python 3.11 or later installed.

## Procedures{#procedures}

### Set up testing environment{#set-up-testing-environment}

1. Provision a machine.

    To test the ultimate performance of Zilliz Cloud, we recommend provisioning a client machines with more than 8 vCPUs to ensure multiple threads.

1. Configure network.

    Network communication will influence the test results, especially in the query testing scenario. To reduce the impact of network latency, we recommend:

    - Deploying the client in the same cloud provider and region as your Zilliz Cloud cluster.

    - Configure your client so that it shares the same VPC with your Zilliz Cloud cluster. Compared to public Internet, VPC can have lower latency. Learn more at [Set up a Private Link](/docs/set-up-a-private-link).

### Install and start VectorDBBench{#install-and-start-vectordbbench}

```bash
# Install VectorDBBench
$ pip install vectordb-bench

# Start VectorDBBench
$ init_bench
```

Below is an example output. You will obtain a local URL in the output. Use it to open the web user interface of VectorDBBench.
