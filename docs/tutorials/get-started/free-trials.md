# Try Zilliz Cloud For Free

Zilliz Cloud offers both **free plan** and **free trial** to help you evaluate or test the powerful vector database features and estimate costs of using Zilliz Cloud. To start, simply [register an account](./register-with-zilliz-cloud) on Zilliz Cloud. No payment information is required.

## Free plan{#free-plan}

Zilliz Cloud offers a free plan that allows you to use Serverless cluster features at no cost. The free plan provides you with:

- 5 GB storage (Enough for 1M 768 dim vectors.)

- 2.5M vCUs per month

- Up to 5 collections

If you need more resources or want to access advanced features, please use the [free trial](./free-trials#free-trial) of our Serverless and Dedicated plans.

## Free trial{#free-trial}

Zilliz Cloud offers free trial for three [subscription plans](./select-zilliz-cloud-service-plans): Serverless, Dedicated (Standard), and Dedicated (Enterprise). 

### Use free trial{#use-free-trial}

When you sign up for Zilliz Cloud with a work email and complete the survey, your organization will receive **$100** in free credits added to your billing account. These credits expire after **30 days** and can be used to explore the Serverless and Dedicated plans. Once the credits are used up or expire, the free trial ends.

After the trial, your organization will be frozen. During this time, your Serverless and Dedicated clusters will be moved to the [recycle bin](./use-recycle-bin), and you won't have access to features exclusive to these clusters (e.g., Backup and restore, alerts, etc.).

To unfreeze your organization, simply [add a payment method](./payment-billing). This will allow you to restore deleted data from the recycle bin. If you don't add a payment method within 30 days of freezing, your Serverless and Dedicated clusters will be permanently deleted, but your organization will still be preserved.

### Earn credits and extend credit expiration{#earn-credits-and-extend-credit-expiration}

When you register with a work email and complete the survey, you’ll receive $100 in free credits. You can earn an extra $100 by subscribing to Zilliz Cloud on [Marketplaces](./subscribe-on-aws-marketplace). Plus, adding a payment method extends the credit expiration to **1 year**.

If you need additional credits or want to extend your trial period, please [contact sales](https://zilliz.com/contact-sales).

### View credit balance{#view-credit-balance}

You can quickly check your remaining credits and their expiration at the bottom of the left navigation pane. 

Alternatively, navigate to the **Credits** section on the **Billing Overview** page.

<Admonition type="info" icon="📘" title="Notes">

<p>To avoid unintentional usage of your credits, you are recommended to manually suspend clusters that are not in use.</p>

</Admonition>

### Free trial notifications{#free-trial-notifications}

During your free trial, you'll receive several email notifications from Zilliz Cloud regarding its status. These emails are sent to organization owners and are triggered by the following events:

- 60% of credits are consumed.

- Credits expiring in less than 3 days.

- Organization frozen due to trial expiration without a valid payment method.

- Upcoming deletion of Serverless and Dedicated clusters as the trial is coming to an end.

- Serverless and Dedicated clusters moved to the recycle bin after the trial ends.

- All credits are used up.

<Admonition type="info" icon="📘" title="Notes">

<p>If you add a payment method before the trial ends, you will no longer receive free trial-related email notifications.</p>
