# Release Notes (Jan 10, 2023)

We are pleased to announce the general availability of a significant update to Zilliz Cloud. This release adds the data preview feature and a demo dataset that can be easily imported into your collection on the console.

- Data preview

    In this release, Zilliz Cloud offers a data preview capability. You can find the **Data Preview** feature tab on each collection page. The preview table lets you view all the values of a set of sampled entities in a collection, which makes it easy to verify your data.

    Along with the data preview capabilities, you can select any of the vectors in the preview table and use them as the query vector. This allows you to quickly verify the neighboring data in your collection.

- Demo dataset

    Zilliz Cloud now provides a demo dataset to help beginners get familiar with the functionalities of vector databases. The demo dataset is derived from a Kaggle dataset. It contains details of over 5,000 articles published between Jan 2020 to August 2020 in prominent publications.

    Now, you can experience the whole set of vector database functionalities easily, with no extra effort needed for data preparation. [Enjoy it!](https://cloud.zilliz.com/signup)
